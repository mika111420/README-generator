# Professional README Generator Code with Node

## Description

This weeks Challenge was to use a starter code to further create an command line application that would generate a README.md file with a users' given input. The motivation was to be able to simplify and streamline the creation of a README file, and automate it. A simple command line interface where users can input their relevant project details, and it generates a professional-looking README file based on the provided user information, shortens time taken to create a project.

I learned quite a bit from this project, mainly the insights into the significance of README files, expanding my Node.js skills, and understanding the power of automation in software development to be more effective in README documentation.


## Installation

To use this application: Clone this repository into a local machine, install the npm dependencies necessary to manage. This applicaton uses Node.js and NPM (use npm install). Next, run the application with ( node index.js ). Then the application will successfully run and be ready for input to generate the README file.
